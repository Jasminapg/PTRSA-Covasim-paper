=======

Background
=============
This repository contains a collection of code and data used to model the transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the UK, using the Covasim model for the paper:

1. **Determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools, the impact of test and trace interventions, and the risk of occurrence of a second COVID-19 epidemic wave in the UK: a modelling study**.

About Covasim
=============

Covasim is a stochastic agent-based simulator for performing COVID-19 analyses. These include projections of indicators such as numbers of infections and peak hospital demand. Covasim can also be used to explore the potential impact of different interventions, including social distancing, school closures, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and vaccination.

The scientific paper describing Covasim is available at http://paper.covasim.org. The recommended citation is:
